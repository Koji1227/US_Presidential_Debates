Well first of all its great to be with you and thank you everybody The Supreme Court Its what its all about Our country is so soits just so imperative that we have the right justices
Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that I represent And she was forced to apologize And apologize she did But these were statements that should never ever have been made
We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments but the Second Amendment which is under absolute siege I believe if my opponent should win this race which I truly dont think will happen we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now But I feel that its absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma
I feel that the justices that I am going to appointand Ive named 20 of themthe justices that Im going to appoint will be prolife They will have a conservative bent They will be protecting the Second Amendment They are great scholars in all cases and theyre people of tremendous respect They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted And I believe thats very very important
I dont think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear Its all about the Constitution ofofand so important the Constitution the way it was meant to be And those are the people that I will appoint
Well the DC vs Heller decision was very stronglyand she was extremely angry about it I watched I mean she was very very angry when upheld And Justice Scalia was so involved And it was a wellcrafted decision But Hillary was extremely upset extremely angry And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say
Well let me just tell you before we go any further In Chicago which has the toughest gun laws in the United States probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence
I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment And I amI dont know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but Im very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA And its the earliest endorsement theyve ever given to anybody who ran for president So Im very honored by all of that
We are going to appoint justicesthis is the best way to help the Second Amendment We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment that will not do damage to the Second Amendment
Right
Well if that would happen because I am prolife and I will be appointing prolife judges I would think that that will go back to the individual states
If they overturned it it will go back to the states
Well if we put another two or perhaps three justices on thats really whats going to bethat will happen And thatll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting prolife justices on the court I will say this It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination
Well I think its terrible If you go with what Hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby
Now you can say that thats OK and Hillary can say that thats OK But its not OK with me because based on what shes saying and based on where shes going and where shes been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day And thats not acceptable
And honestly nobody has business doing what I just said doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth Nobody has that
Well first of all she wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting in line for many many years We need strong borders
In the audience tonight we have four mothers ofI mean these are unbelievable people that Ive gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country Theyre coming in illegally Drugs are pouring in through the border We have no country if we have no border
Hillary wants to give amnesty She wants to have open borders The borderas you know the Border Patrol agents 16500plus ICE last week endorsed me First time theyve ever endorsed a candidate It means their job is tougher But they know whats going on They know it better than anybody They want strong borders They feel we have to have strong borders
I was up in New Hampshire the other day The biggest complaint they haveits with all of the problems going on in the world many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama All of the problemsthe single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border Its just pouring and destroying their youth Its poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people We have to have strong borders We have to keep the drugs out of our country We areright now were getting the drugs theyre getting the cash We need strong borders We need absolutewe cannot give amnesty
Now I want to build the wall We need the wall And the Border Patrol ICE they all want the wall We stop the drugs We shore up the border One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords all of the bad oneswe have some bad bad people in this country that have to go out Were going to get them out were going to secure the border And once the border is secured at a later date well make a determination as to the rest But we have some bad hombres here and were going to get them out
Chris I think its
I think I should respond to that First of all I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico Very nice man We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals Believe me The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody Its a disaster
Hillary Clinton wanted the wall Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts Now she never gets anything done so naturally the wall wasnt built But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall
We are a country of laws We either haveand by the way
Wellwell but she said one thing
And the wall
President Obama has moved millions of people out Nobody knows about it nobody talks about it But under Obama millions of people have been moved out of this country Theyve been deported She doesnt want to say that but thats whats happened and thats what happened big league
As far as moving these people out and movingwe either have a country or we dont Were a country of laws We either have a border or we dont
Now you can come back in and you can become a citizen But its very unfair We have millions of people that did it the right way Theyre on line Theyre waiting Were going to speed up the process big league because its very inefficient But theyre on line and theyre waiting to become citizens
Very unfair that somebody runs across the border becomes a citizen under her plan you have open borders You would have a disaster on trade and you will have a disaster with your open borders
But what she doesnt say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is
Thank you
That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders OK How did we get on to Putin
So just to finish on the borders
She wants open borders People are going to pour into our country People are going to come in from Syria She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama and he has thousands and thousands of people They have no idea where they come from
And you see we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country She wont even mention the words and neither will President Obama So I just want to tell you she wants open borders
Now we can talk about Putin I dont know Putin He said nice things about me If we got along well that would be good If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS that would be good
He has no respect for her He has no respect for our president And Ill tell you what Were in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads1800 by the waywhere they expanded and we didnt 1800 nuclear warheads And shes playing chicken Look Putin
 from everything I see has no respect for this person
No puppet No puppet
Youre the puppet
No youre the puppet
She has no idea whether its Russia China or anybody else
She has no idea
Hillary you have no idea
And our country has no idea
Yeah I doubt it I doubt it
She doesnt like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way
Excuse me Putin has outsmarted her in Syria
Hes outsmarted her every step of the way
Yes thats fine
By Russia or anybody else
Of course I condemn Of course II dont know Putin I have no idea
I never met Putin This is not my best friend But if the United States got along with Russia wouldnt be so bad
Let me tell you Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way Whether its Syria you name it Missiles Take a look at the startup that they signed The Russians have said according to many many reports I cant believe they allowed us to do this They create warheads and we cant The Russians cant believe it She has been outsmarted by Putin
And all you have to do is look at the Middle East Theyve taken over Weve spent 6 trillion Theyve taken over the Middle East She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody Ive ever seen in any government whatsoever
And she always will be
Wrong
I have 200 generals
 and admirals 21 endorsing me 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients As far as Japan and other countries we are being ripped off by everybody in thewere defending other countries We are spending a fortune doing it They have the bargain of the century
All I said is we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia Japan Germany South Korea and many other places We cannot continue to affordshe took that as saying nuclear weapons
Look shes been proven to be a liar on so many different ways This is just another lie
Theres no quote Youre not going to find a quote from me
And defend yourselves
And defend yourselves I didnt say nuclear And defend yourself
Yes
Well first of all before I start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes Her tax plan is a disaster And she can say all she wants about college tuition And Im a big proponent Were going to do a lot of things for college tuition But the rest of the publics going to be paying for it We will have a massive massive tax increase under Hillary Clintons plan
But Id like to start off where we left because when I said Japan and Germany and Imnot to single them out but South Korea these are very rich powerful countries Saudi Arabia nothing but money We protect Saudi Arabia Why arent they paying
She immediatelywhen she heard this I questioned it and I questioned NATO Why arent the NATO questionedwhy arent they paying Because they werent paying
Since I did thisthis was a year agoall of a sudden theyre paying And Ive been given a lota lot of credit for it All of a sudden theyre starting to pay up They have to pay up Were protecting people they have to pay up And Im a big fan of NATO But they have to pay up
She comes out and said we love our allies we think our allies are great Well its awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are
We have to tell Japan in a very nice way we have to tell Germany all of these countries South Korea we have to say you have to help us out We have during his regime during President Obamas regime weve doubled our national debt Were up to 20 trillion
So my planwere going to renegotiate trade deals Were going to have a lot of free trade Were going to have free trade more free trade than we have right now But we have horrible deals Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed NAFTA one of the worst deals ever Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy
You look at all of the places that I just left you go to Pennsylvania you go to Ohio you go to Florida you go to any of them You go upstate New York Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places Were bringing our jobs back
I am going to renegotiate NAFTA And if I cant make a great dealthen were going to terminate NAFTA and were going to create new deals Were going to have trade but were goingwere going to terminate it were going to make a great trade deal
And if we cant were going to do itwere going to go a separate way because it has been a disaster We are going to cut taxes massively Were going to cut business taxes massively Theyre going to start hiring people Were going to bring the 25 trillion
 thats offshore back into the country We are going to start the engine rolling again because
 right now our country is dying at 1 percent GDP
You cant
Correct
Over a 10year period
So I just left some high representatives of India Theyre growing at 8 percent China is growing at 7 percent And that for them is a catastrophically low number
We are growingour last report came outand its right around the 1 percent level And I think its going down Last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anemic jobs report A terrible jobs report In fact I said is that the last jobs report before the election Because if it is I should win easily it was so bad The report was so bad
Look our country is stagnant Weve lost our jobs Weve lost our businesses Were not making things anymore relatively speaking Our product is pouring in from China pouring in from Vietnam pouring in from all over the world
Ive visited so many communities This has been such an incredible education for me Chris Ive gotten to know so manyIve developed so many friends over the last year And they cry when they see whats happened I pass factories that were thriving 20 25 years ago and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent it is just horrible whats happened to these people in these communities
Now she can say that her husband did well but boy did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in because it didnt really kick in very much but it kicked in after they left Boy did they suffer That was one of the worst things thats ever been signed by our country
Now she wants to sign TransPacific Partnership And she wants it She lied when she said she didnt call it the gold standard in one of the debates She totally lied She did call it the gold standard And they actually factchecked and they said I was right I was so honored
And that will be as bad as NAFTA
Well let me just saylet me just say
I ask a simple question Shes been doing this for 30 years Why the hell didnt you do it over the last 15 20 years
You were very much involvedexcuse me My turn You were very much involved in every aspect of this country Very much And you do have experience I say the one thing you have over me is experience but its bad experience because what youve done has turned out badly
For 30 years youve been in a position to help and if you say that I use steel or I use something else Imake it impossible for me to do that I wouldnt mind
The problem is you talk but you dont get anything done Hillary You dont Just like when you ran the State Department 6 billion was missing How do you miss 6 billion You ran the State Department 6 billion was either stolen They dont know Its gone 6 billion If you become president this country is going to be in some mess Believe me
Give me a break
Well I think I did a much better job I built a massive company a great company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world worth many many billions of dollars I started with a 1 million loan I agree with that Its a 1 million loan But I built a phenomenal company
And if we could run our country the way Ive run my company we would have a country that you would be so proud of You would even be proud of it
And frankly when you look at her real record take a look at Syria Take a look at the migration Take a look at Libya Take a look at Iraq She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because whenwe should have never been in Iraq but once we were there we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries And now I listen how shes going to get rid of ISIS Shes going to get rid of nobody
Well first of all those stories have been largely debunked Those peopleI dont know those people I have a feeling how they came I believe it was her campaign that did it
Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence Shes the one and Obama that caused the violence They hired peoplethey paid them 1500 and theyre on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things
I would say the only waybecause those stories are all totally false I have to say that And I didnt even apologize to my wife whos sitting right here because I didnt do anything I didnt know any of theseI didnt see these women
These womenthe woman on the plane theI think they want either fame or her campaign did it And I think its her campaign Because what I saw what they did which is a criminal act by the way where theyre telling people to go out and start fistfights and start violence
And Ill tell you what in particular in Chicago people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot And that was now all on tape started by her I believe Chris that she got these people to step forward If it wasnt they get their 10 minutes of fame But they were all totallyit was all fiction It was lies and it was fiction
I did not say that I did not say that
I did not say that
Nobody has more respect for women than I do Nobody 
Nobody has more respect
And frankly those stories have been largely debunked And I really want to just talk about something slightly different
She mentions this which is all fiction all fictionalized probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign But I will tell you what isnt fictionalized are her emails where she destroyed 33000 emails criminally criminally after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress
What happened to the FBI I dont know We have a great general fourstar general today you read it in all of the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI One lie Shes lied hundreds of times to the people to Congress and to the FBI Hes going to probably go to jail This is a fourstar general And she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the United States Thats really what you should be talking about not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign
Wrong
So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence Its on tape
The other things are false but honestly Id love to talk about getting rid of ISIS and Id love to talk about other things
 but those other charges as she knows are false
I think that its been very well
Its been very well studied
 and its a criminal enterprise and so many people know it
Its a criminal enterprise Saudi Arabia giving 25 million Qatar all of these countries You talk about women and womens rights So these are people that push gays off businessoff buildings These are people that kill women and treat women horribly And yet you take their money
So Id like to ask you right now why dont you give back the money that youve taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly Why dont you give back the money I think it would be a great gesture
Because she takes a tremendous amount of money And you take a look at the people of Haiti I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida And I want to tell you they hate the Clintons because whats happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace And you know it and they know it and everybody knows it
They dont want you to help them anymore

Id like to mention one thing Trump Foundation small foundation People contribute I contribute The money goes 100 percent100 percent goes to different charities including a lot of military I dont get anything I dont buy boats I dont buy planes What happensthe money goes to them
No it waswe put up the American flag And thats it They put up the American flag We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag
There was There was And by the way
 the moneythe money went to Fisher House where they build housesthe money that youre talking about went to Fisher House where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets
So let me just tell you very quickly were entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges and we do it And all of her donorsjust about all of themI know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars Soros George Soros took hundreds of millions of dollars
Let me just explain
Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do
You know what she should have done
And you know Hillary what you should have done you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator
 because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do except even more so
You should have changed the law But you wont change the law because you take in so much money I mean I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump
But I will tell you I sat there I sat there watching ad after ad after ad false ad All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know youre going to protect them And frankly you should have changed the laws
If you dont like what I did you should have changed the laws
I will look at it at the time Im not looking at anything now Ill look at it at the time
What Ive seenwhat Ive seen is so bad First of all the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pileon is so amazing The New York Times actually wrote an article about it but they dont even care Its so dishonest And theyve poisoned the mind of the voters
But unfortunately for them I think the voters are seeing through it I think theyre going to see through it Well find out on November 8th But I think theyre going to see through it
If you lookexcuse me Chrisif you look at your voter rolls you will see millions of people that are registered to votemillions this isnt coming from methis is coming from Pew Report and other placesmillions of people that are registered to vote that shouldnt be registered to vote
So let me just give you one other thing So I talk about the corrupt media I talk about the millions of peopletell you one other thing She shouldnt be allowed to run Its crookedshesshes guilty of a very very serious crime She should not be allowed to run
And just in that respect I say its rigged because she should never
Chris she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with emails and so many other things
What Im saying is that I will tell you at the time Ill keep you in suspense OK
Should have gotten it 
I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did including meeting with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona I think its disgraceful I think its a disgrace
I think weve never had a situation so bad in this country 
Let me tell you Mosul is so sad We had Mosul But when she left when she took everybody out we lost Mosul Now were fighting again to get Mosul The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul
About three months ago I started reading that they want to get the leaders and theyre going to attack Mosul Whatever happened to the element of surprise OK We announce were going after Mosul I have been reading about going after Mosul now for abouthow long is it Hillary three months These people have all left Theyve all left
The element of surprise Douglas MacArthur George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country So were now fighting for Mosul that we had All she had to do was stay there and now were going in to get it
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it And the only reason they did it is because shes running for the office of president and they want to look tough They want to look good He violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes made all mistakes Thats why we have the great migration But she wanted to look good for the election So theyre going in
But whos going to get Mosul really Well take Mosul eventually But the wayif you look at whats happening much tougher than they thought Much much tougher Much more dangerous Going to be more deaths that they thought
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because theyre smart They say what do we need this for So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing And Iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the really stupidthe stupidest deal of all time a deal thats going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because Iran as I said many years ago Iran is taking over Iraq something theyve wanted to do forever but weve made it so easy for them
So were now going to take Mosul And you know whos going to be the beneficiary Iran Oh yeah theyre makingI mean they are outsmartinglook youre not there you might be involved in that decision But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq You shouldnt have been in Iraq but you did vote for it You shouldnt have been in Iraq but once you were in Iraq you should have never left the way
The point is the big winner is going to be Iran
Wrong
Wrong
Wrong
Chris we dont gain anything
Iran is taking over Iraq
Iran is taking over Iraq We dont gain anything
We wouldve gained if they did it by surprise
We would have gained if they did it by surprise
No you are the one thats unfit You know WikiLeaks just actually came outJohn Podesta said some horrible things about you and boy was he right He said some beauties And you know Bernie Sanders he said you have bad judgment You do
And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know were going in and all of the people that we really wantedthe leaderstheyre all gone If you think that was good then you do Now John Podesta said you have terrible instincts Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment I agree with both
Which is a big mistake
Its a catastrophe I mean
 its a mess
Have you seen it Have you seen it
Have you seen whats happened to Aleppo
OK so it hasnt fallen Take a look at it
Thats right And they are being slaughtered
 because of bad decisions
Well Aleppo is a disaster Its a humanitarian nightmare But it has fallen from thefrom any standpoint I mean what do you need a signed document Take a look at Aleppo It is so sad when you see whats happened
And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton because whats happened is by fighting Assad who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought and now shes going to say oh he loves Assad sheshes just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama And everyone thought he was gone two years ago three years ago Hehe aligned with Russia
He now also aligned with Iran who we made very powerful We gave them 150 billion back We give them 17 billion in cash I mean cash Bundles of cash as big as this stage We gave them 17 billion
Now they havehe has aligned with Russia and with Iran They dont want ISIS but they have other things because were backingwere backing rebels We dont know who the rebels are Were giving them lots of money lots of everything We dont know who the rebels are And when and ifand its not going to happen because you have Russia and you have Iran now But if they ever did overthrow Assad you might end up withas bad as Assad is and hes a bad guy but you may very well end up with worse than Assad
If she did nothing wed be in much better shape And this is whats caused the great migration where shes taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who probably in many casesnot probably who are definitely
 in many cases ISISaligned and we now have them in our country and wait until you seethis is going to be the great Trojan horse And wait until you see what happens in the coming years Lots of luck Hillary Thanks a lot for doing a great job
But I just have to
Its so ridiculous what sheshe will defeat ISIS We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place And right now theyre in 32 countries
We should havewait one second They had a ceasefire three weeks ago A ceasefire United States Russia and Syria And during the ceasefire Russia took over vast swatches of land and then they said we dont want the ceasefire anymore
We are so outplayed on missiles on ceasefires They are outplayed Now she wasnt there I assume she had nothing to do with it But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad and by the wayand by Iran Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is
Well I say theyre wrong because Im going to create tremendous jobs And were bringing GDP from really 1 percent which is what it is now and if she got in it will be less than zero But were bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent And if we do you dont have to bother asking your question because we have a tremendous machine We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again To do that were taking back jobs Were not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs we dont make our product anymore Its very sad But Im going to create athe kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry We used to be there Weve given it up Weve become very very sloppy
Weve had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world bigger than companies You take these big companies these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we dont use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary I must say But we dont use those people Those are the peoplethese are the greatest negotiators in the world We have the greatest businesspeople in the world We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals
We use political hacks We use people that get the position because they gavethey made a campaign contribution and theyre dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are So we have to use our great people
But that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we havent seen in many decades And people Chris will again go back to work and theyll make a lot of money And well have companies that will grow and expand and start from new
Yeah yeah weve heardweve heard this before Hillary
Weve heard this before
Thank you Hillary Could I just respond
Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade I disagreed with him We should have been much tougher on trade even then Ive been waiting for years Nobody does it right
And frankly now were going to do it right
Im cutting taxes Were going to grow the economy Its going to grow at a record rate of growth
No its going to totally help you And one thing we have to do Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare Its destroying our country Its destroying our businesses our small business and our big businesses We have to repeal and replace Obamacare
You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year 17 it is a disaster If we dont repeal and replacenow its probably going to die of its own weight But Obamacare has to go Itsthe premiums are going up 60 percent 70 percent 80 percent Next year theyre going to go up over 100 percent
And Im really glad that the premiums have startedat least the people see whats happening because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse and it cant get any worse Bad health care at the most expensive price We have to repeal and replace Obamacare
Such a nasty woman
Your husband disagrees with you
Shes raising the money from the people she wants to control Doesnt work that way
But when I started this campaign I started it very strongly Its called Make America Great Again Were going to make America great We have a depleted military It has to be helped has to be fixed We have the greatest people on Earth in our military We dont take care of our veterans We take care of illegal immigrants people that come into the country illegally better than we take care of our vets That cant happen
Our policemen and women are disrespected We need law and order but we need justice too Our inner cities are a disaster You get shot walking to the store They have no education They have no jobs I will do more for AfricanAmericans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes
All shes done is talk to the AfricanAmericans and to the Latinos but they get the vote and then they come back they say well see you in four years We are going to make America strong again and we are going to make America great again and it has to start now We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama and thats what you get when you get her
