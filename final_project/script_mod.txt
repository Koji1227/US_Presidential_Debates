Good evening from the Thomas and Mack Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Im Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the third and final of the 2016 presidential debates between Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Donald J Trump
This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates The commission has designed the format Six roughly 15minute segments with twominute answers to the first question then open discussion for the rest of each segment Both campaigns have agreed to those rules
For the record I decided the topics and the questions in each topic None of those questions has been shared with the commission or the two candidates The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent No cheers boos or other interruptions so we and you can focus on what the candidates have to say
No noise except right now as we welcome the Democratic nominee for president Secretary Clinton and the Republican nominee for president Mr Trump 
Secretary Clinton Mr Trump welcome Lets get right to it The first topic is the Supreme Court
You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments
Which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century
First of all where do you want to see the court take the country And secondly whats your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted Do the founders words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances In this segment Secretary Clinton you go first You have two minutes
Secretary Clinton thank you
Mr Trump same question Where do you want to see the court take the country And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted
Mr Trump thank you
We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion I want to focus on two issues that in fact by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land First is one that you mentioned Mr Trump and that is guns
Secretary Clinton you said last year let me quote The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment And now in fact in the 2008 Heller case the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision Whats wrong with that
Let me bring Mr Trump in here The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact one of the top questions that they got How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected You just heard Secretary Clintons answer Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation that in fact she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms
Well let me bring in Secretary Clinton Were you extremely upset
Let me bring Mr Trump back into this because in fact you oppose any limits on assault weapons any limits on highcapacity magazines You support a national right to carry law Why sir
Well lets pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there and thats the issue of abortion
Mr Trump youre prolife But I want to ask you specifically Do you want the court including the justices that you will name to overturn Roe v Wade which includesin fact statesa womans right to abortion
But Im asking you specifically Would you like to
But what Im asking you sir is do you want to see the court overturnyou just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v Wade
Secretary Clinton
Secretary Clinton
Im going to give you a chance to respond but I want to ask you Secretary Clinton I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights You also voted against a ban on lateterm partialbirth abortions Why
Mr Trump your reaction And particularly on this issue of lateterm partialbirth abortions
All right But just briefly I want to move on to another segment
All right Lets move on to the subject of immigration And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration Actually there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you
Mr Trump you want to build a wall Secretary Clinton you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border Mr Trump you are calling for major deportations Secretary Clinton you say that within your first 100 days as president youre going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship The question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong
Mr Trump you go first in this segment You have two minutes
Mr Trump thank you Same question to you Secretary Clinton Basically why are you right and Mr Trump is wrong
Thank you Secretary Clinton I want to follow up
OK
Well let mewait wait sir let me
Now wait Id like to hear from
Id like to hearId like to hear from Secretary Clinton
Mr Trump
I want to
Secretary Clinton I want to
Well let meSecretary
Secretary Clinton
Secretary Clinton excuse me Secretary Clinton
Secretary Clinton I want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid 225000 weve learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this and I want to quote My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders So thats the question
Thats the question Please quiet everybody Is that your dream open borders
Well
Hold onhold on wait Hold on folks Because wethis is going to end up getting out of control Lets try to keep it quiet sofor the candidates and for the American people
Yes
Wait but
Secretary Clinton
Mr Trump
Mr Trump
Im not a potted plant here I do get to ask some questions
And I would like to ask you this direct question The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks Even if you dont know for sure whether they are do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election
You condemn their interference
Im not askingIm asking do you condemn
Were a long way away from immigration but Im going to let you finish this topic You got about 45 seconds
Very quickly
OK
Were going tono we are going to move on to the next topic which is the economy And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster Secretary Clinton in your plan government plays a big role You see more government spending more entitlements more tax credits more tax penalties Mr Trump you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation
Were going to drill down into this a little bit more But in this overview please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponents plan will not In this round you go first Secretary Clinton
Secretary thank you Mr Trump why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clintons
Time Mr Trump
Mr Trump
Secretary
Secretary Clinton I want to pursue your plan because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009 which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949
Thank you sir
You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didnt get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus So is your plan basically moreeven more of the Obama stimulus
Mr Trump even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers dont add up that your idea and youve talked about 25 million jobs created 4 percent
 growth is unrealistic And they sayyou talk a lot about growing the energy industry They say with oil prices as low as they are right now thats unrealistic as well Your response sir
I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that and then I want to pivot to onesixth of the economy
 which is Obamacare But go ahead briefly
Mr Trump
Secretary Clinton Go ahead Mr Trump
All right We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States Mr Trump at the last debate you said your talk about grabbing women was just that talk and that youd never actually done it And since then as we all know nine women have come forward and said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent
Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years why would they all in this last couple of weeks make upyou deny thiswhy would they all make up these stories
And since this is a question for both of you Secretary Clinton Mr Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse Mr Trump you go first
Secretary Clinton
Her two minutessir her two minutes Her two minutes
Its her two minutes
Mr Trump
Please everybody
Secretary Clinton
During the last
OK
In this bucket about fitness to be president theres been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate Id like to ask you about them These are questions that the American people have
Secretary Clinton during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state but emails show that donors got special access to you Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from nondonors and some of those donors got contracts government contracts taxpayer money
Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee And why isnt what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation why isnt it what Mr Trump calls pay to play
Secretary Clinton
Secretary Clinton respectfully this isthis is an open discussion
And the specific question went to pay for play Do you want to talk about that
Lets ask Mr Trump
Please let Mr Trump speak
Please let Mr Trump speak

Secretary Clinton
All right
Wasnt some of the money used to settle your lawsuits sir
Right But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County and the money came from your foundation
 instead of MaraLago or yourself sir
I want to get into one
I want
We
But no we heard this
Mr Trump weOK
Folks we heard this
Folks we heard this
Mr Trump
Mr Trump I want to ask you about one last question in this topic You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you
Your running mate Governor Pence pledged on Sunday that he and youhis wordswill absolutely accept the result of this election Today your daughter Ivanka said the same thing I want to ask you here on the stage tonight Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutelysir that you will absolutely accept the result of this election
But sir theres
But
But sir there is a tradition in this countryin fact one of the prides of this countryis the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hardfought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner Not saying that youre necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country Are you saying youre not prepared now to commit to that principle
OK
Hold on Hold on folks Hold on folks
All right
Hold on folks This doesnt do any good for anyone Lets please continue the debate and lets move on to the subject of foreign hot spots
The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq the question then becomes what happens the day after And thats something that whichever of you ends upwhoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront
Will you put US troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesnt come back or isnt replaced by something even worse Secretary Clinton you go first in this segment You have two minutes
Mr Trump same question If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq willwould you be willing to put US troops in there to prevent their return or something else
Sir your two minutes are up
Secretary Clinton its
Wait wait wait Secretary Clinton its an open discussion
Secretary please let Mr Trump speak
Lets turn to Aleppo Mr Trump in the last debate you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo And I want to follow up on that because you said several things in that debate which were not true sir You said that Aleppo has basically fallen In fact therein fact there are
Its a catastrophe but there
There are a quarter of
Sir
Sir if I may finish my question
Well there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered
Yes
If I may just finish here and you also said thatthat Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS In fact they have been the ones whove been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo and they just announced a humanitarian pause in effect admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo Would you like to clear that up sir
Let me
Secretary Clinton you have talked aboutand in the last debate and again todaythat you would impose a nofly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there President Obama has refused to do that because he fears its going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict
And General Joseph Dunford the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says you impose a nofly zone chances are youre going to get into a warhis wordswith Syria and Russia So the question I have is if you impose a nofly zonefirst of all how do you respond to their concerns Secondly if you impose a nofly zone and a Russian plane violates that does President Clinton shoot that plane down
Folks I want to get into our final segment
Real quick
OK
Mr Trump Secretary Clintonno we need to move on to our final segment and that is the national debt which has not been discussed until tonight
Our national debt as a share of the economy our GDP is now 77 percent Thats the highest since just after World War II But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Secretary Clinton under your plan debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years Mr Trump under your plan they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years The question is why are both of you ignoring this problem Mr Trump you go first
Secretary Clinton
Time
Well no sir because were running out of time
OK
All right The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements which is 60 percent of all federal spending Now the Committee for federala Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicares going to run out of money in the 2020s Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s and at that time recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits
So in effect the final question I want to ask you in this regard isand let me start with you Mr Trump would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts in effect a grand bargain on entitlements
Thats not going to help in the entitlements
And Secretary Clinton same question because at this point Social Security and Medicare are going to run out the trust funds are going to run out of money Will you as president entertainwill you consider a grand bargain a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs
This isthis is the final time probably to both of your delight that youre going to be on a stage together in this campaign I would like to end it on a positive note You had not agreed to closing statements but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you havent prepared closing statements
So Id like you each to takeand were going to put a clock up a minute as the final question in the final debate to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president This is another new minisegment Secretary Clinton its your turn to go first
Secretary Clinton thank you
Mr Trump
Thank you both 
Secretary Clintonhold on just a moment folks Secretary Clinton Mr Trump I want to thank you both for participating in all three of these debates
That brings to an end this years debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates We want to thank the University of Nevada Las Vegas and its students for having us Now the decision is up to you
While millions have already voted Election Day November 8th is just 20 days away One thing everyone here can agree on We hope you will go vote It is one of the honors and obligations of living in this great country Thank you and good night
