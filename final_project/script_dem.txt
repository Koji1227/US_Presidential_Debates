Thank you very much Chris And thanks to UNLV for hosting us
You know I think when we talk about the Supreme Court it really raises the central issue in this election namely what kind of country are we going to be What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens What kind of rights will Americans have
And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy For me that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of womens rights on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community that will stand up and say no to Citizens United a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system
I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court But I feel that at this point in our countrys history it is important that we not reverse marriage equality that we not reverse Roe v Wade that we stand up against Citizens United we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace that we stand up and basically say The Supreme Court should represent all of us
Thats how I see the court and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans
And I look forward to having that opportunity I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them Thats the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents or not but they go forward with the process
Well first of all I support the Second Amendment I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years I represented upstate New York I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership It goes back to the founding of our country
But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation Because I support the Second Amendment doesnt mean that I want people who shouldnt have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family
And so when I think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns I think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole Theres other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment
You mentioned the Heller decision And what I was saying that you referenced Chris was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them And the court didnt accept that reasonable regulation but theyve accepted many others So I see no conflict between saving peoples lives and defending the Second Amendment
Well I was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions
But theres no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment that I also believe theres an individual right to bear arms That is not in conflict with sensible commonsense regulation
And you know look I understand that Donalds been strongly supported by the NRA The gun lobbys on his side Theyre running millions of dollars of ads against me And I regret that because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say of course were going to protect and defend the Second Amendment But were going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year
Well I strongly support Roe v Wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate most difficult in many cases decisions about her health care that one can imagine And in this case its not only about Roe v Wade It is about whats happening right now in America
So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood which of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country
Donald has said hes in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood I will defend Planned Parenthood I will defend Roe v Wade and I will defend womens rights to make their own health care decisions
And we have come too far to have that turned back now And indeed he said women should be punished that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking
Because Roe v Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account And when I voted as a senator I did not think that that was the case
The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account
Well that is not what happens in these cases And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate You should meet with some of the women that I have met with women I have known over the course of my life This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make And I do not believe the government should be making it
You know Ive had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country Ive been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or forced women to bear children like they used to do in Romania And I can tell you The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice And I will stand up for that right
Well as he was talking I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas Carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not They work hard they do everything they can to give her a good life
And youre right I dont want to rip families apart I dont want to be sending parents away from children I dont want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country
We have 11 million undocumented people They have 4 million American citizen children 15 million people He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation Now heres what that means It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business rounding up people who are undocumented And we would then have to put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country
I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation I think its an idea that would rip our country apart
I have been for border security for years I voted for border security in the United States Senate And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security But I want to put our resources where I think theyre most needed Getting rid of any violent person Anybody who should be deported we should deport them
When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building he went to Mexico he had a meeting with the Mexican president Didnt even raise it He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said were not paying for that wall
So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly And thats why Im introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with a path to citizenship
I voted for border security and there are
There are some limited places where that was appropriate There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that
But it is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing he started his campaign bashing immigrants calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants
Now what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers cant exploit them and undercut Americans wages
And Donald knows a lot about this He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do You complain Ill get you deported
I want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts American workers
We will not have open borders That is
That is a rank mischaracterization
We will have secure borders but well also have reform And this used to be a bipartisan issue Ronald Reagan was the last president
 to sign immigration reform and George W Bush supported it as well
Well if you went on to read the rest of the sentence I was talking about energy You know we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined And I do want us to have an electric grid an energy system that crosses borders I think that would be a great benefit to us
But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks And whats really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans They have hacked American websites American accounts of private people of institutions Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet
This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government clearly from Putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election
So I actually think the most important question of this evening Chris is finally will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in this election that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans which he actually encouraged in the past Those are the questions we need answered Weve never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before
Well thats because hed rather have a puppet as president of the United States
And its pretty clear
Its pretty clear you wont admit
 that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America that you encouraged espionage against our people that you are willing to spout the Putin line sign up for his wish list break up NATO do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race
So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation Weve never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election We have 1717 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election I find that deeply disturbing
And I think its time you take a stand
I am not quoting myself
I am quoting 17
 17 intelligencedo you doubt 17 military and civilian
 agencies
Well hed rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us I find that just absolutely
II find it ironic that hes raising nuclear weapons This is a person who has been very cavalier even casual about the use of nuclear weapons Hes
 advocated more countries getting them Japan Korea even Saudi Arabia He said well if we have them why dont we use them which I think is terrifying
But heres the deal The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed Theres about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so And thats why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button
Well Im just quoting you when you were asked
 about a potential nuclearnuclear competition in Asia you said you know go ahead enjoy yourselves folks That kind
 of languagewell
The United States has kept the peacethe United States has kept the peace through our alliances Donald wants to tear up our alliances I think it makes the world safer and frankly it makes the United States safer I would work with our allies in Asia in Europe in the Middle East and elsewhere Thats the only way were going to be able to keep the peace
Well I think when the middle class thrives America thrives And so my plan is based on growing the economy giving middleclass families many more opportunities I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing I think we can compete with highwage countries and I believe we should New jobs and clean energy not only to fight climate change which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses
I want us to do more to help small business Thats where twothirds of the new jobs are going to come from I want us to raise the national minimum wage because people who live in poverty should notwho work fulltime should not still be in poverty And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do
I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college Thats why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future I want to make college debtfree and for families making less than 125000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted
And were going to work hard to make sure that it is because we are going to go where the money is Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share Were going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country
That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs By contrast Donalds plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 35 million jobs Why Because his whole plan is to cut taxes to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations adding 20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before because it truly will be trickledown economics on steroids
So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession
Well let me translate that if I can Chris because
 the fact is hes going to advocate for the largest tax cuts weve ever seen three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign I will not raise taxes on anyone making 250000 or less
I also will not add a penny to the debt I have costed out what Im going to do He will through his massive tax cuts add 20 trillion to the debt
Well he mentioned the debt We know how to get control of the debt When my husband was president we went from a 300 billion deficit to a 200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt When President Obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression He has cut the deficit by twothirds
So yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people So I do have investments investments in new jobs investments in education skill training and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead Thats the kind of approach that will work
Cutting taxes on the wealthy weve tried that It has not worked the way that it has been promised
Well its a combination Chris And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited it was a real touchandgo situation I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state Ive never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy
I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy He doesnt get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions But it was a terrible recession
So now weve dug ourselves out of it were standing but were not yet running So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up not the top down That is not going to work
Thats why what I have put forward doesnt add a penny to the debt but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs higherpaying jobs Were beginning to see some increase in incomes and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs Weve got to do more to get the whole economy moving and thats what I believe I will be able to do
Well first let me say number one when I saw the final agreement for TPP I said I was against it It didnt meet my test Ive had the same test Does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security Im against it now Ill be against it after the election Ill be against it when Im president
Theres only one of us on this stage whos actually shipped jobs to Mexico because thats Donald Hes shipped jobs to 12 countries including Mexico
But he mentioned China And you know one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets I have fought against that as a senator Ive stood up against it as secretary of state
Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum In fact the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers not American steelworkers
Thats the kind of approach that is just not going to work
Were going to pull the country together Were going to have trade agreements that we enforce Thats why Im going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history And were going to enforce those agreements and were going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products
No I voted
Well first of all what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue its been debunked numerous times
But I think its really an important issue He raised the 30 years of experience so let me just talk briefly about that You know back in the 1970s I worked for the Childrens Defense Fund And I was taking on discrimination against AfricanAmerican kids in schools He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings
In the 1980s I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas He was borrowing 14 million from his father to start his businesses In the 1990s I went to Beijing and I said womens rights are human rights He insulted a former Miss Universe Alicia Machado called her an eating machine
And on the day when I was in the Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice he was hosting the Celebrity Apprentice So Im happy to compare my 30 years of experience what Ive done for this country trying to help in every way I could especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 years and Ill let the American people make that decision
Well
At the last debate we heard Donald talking about what he did to women And after that a number of women have come forward saying thats exactly what he did to them Now what was his response Well he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted
In fact he went on to say
He went on to say Look at her I dont think so About another woman he said That wouldnt be my first choice He attacked the woman reporter writing the story called her disgusting as he has called a number of women during this campaign
Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger He goes after their dignity their selfworth and I dont think there is a woman anywhere who doesnt know what that feels like So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women Thats who Donald is
I think its really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president how we want to bring our country together where we dont want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity we lift people up and we make our country even greater
America is great because America is good And it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren
Well every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable like what these women are saying he immediately goes to denying responsibility And its not just about women He never apologizes or says hes sorry for anything
So we know what he has said and what hes done to women But he also went after a disabled reporter mocked and mimicked him on national television
He went after Mr and Mrs Khan the parents of a young man who died serving our country a Gold Star family because of their religion He went after John McCain a prisoner of war said he prefers people who arent captured He went after a federal judge born in Indiana but who Donald said couldnt be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican
So its not one thing This is a pattern a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies That is not who America is
And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign more and more people will understand whats at stake in this election It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have
Well everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our countrys interests and our values The State Department has said that I think thats been proven
But I am happy in fact Im thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a worldrenowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does You know I could talk for the rest of the debateI know I dont have the time to do that
But just briefly the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIVAIDS to afford treatment and thats about half of all the people in the world who are getting treatment In partnership with the American Health Association
 we have made environments in schools healthier for kids including healthier lunches
Well it is an open discussion And you
Well but there is nobut there is no evidencebut there is
There is a lot of evidence about the very good work
 and the high rankings
Well very quickly we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country Im very proud of that We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations And Id be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation which took money from other people and bought a sixfoot portrait of Donald I mean who does that It just was astonishing
But when it comes to Haiti Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere The earthquake and the hurricanes it has devastated Haiti Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years The Clinton Foundation raised 30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had
We have done things to help small businesses agriculture and so much else And were going to keep working to help Haiti
 because its an important part of the American experience
But of course theres no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasnt released his tax returns He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40plus years who has not released his tax returns so everything he says about charity or anything else we cant prove it You can look at our tax returns Weve got them all out there
But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago Chris You know half of all immigrantsundocumented immigrants in our countryactually pay federal income tax So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire I find that just astonishing
Well you know
Made with Chinese steel
Well Chris let me respond to that because thats horrifying You know every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction he claims whatever it is is rigged against him
The FBI conducted a yearlong investigation into my emails They concluded there was no case he said the FBI was rigged He lost the Iowa caucus He lost the Wisconsin primary He said the Republican primary was rigged against him Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him There was even a time when he didnt get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him
This isthis is a mindset This is how Donald thinks And its funny but its also really troubling
So that is not the way our democracy works Weve been around for 240 years Weve had free and fair elections Weve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election You know President Obama said the other day when youre whining before the game is even finished 
 it just shows youre not up to doing the job And letsyou know lets be clear about what he is saying and what that means He is denigratinghes talking down our democracy And I for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position
Well I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army supported by Kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force I dont think that is in our interest and I dont think that would be smart to do In fact Chris I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself
The goal here is to take back Mosul Its going to be a hard fight Ive got no illusions about that And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa which is the ISIS headquarters
I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a reala really successful military operation But we know weve got lots of work to do Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians continue
So I have said look we need to keep our eye on ISIS Thats why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home why we have to go after them from the air on the ground online why we have to make sure here at home we dont let terrorists buy weapons If youre too dangerous to fly youre too dangerous to buy a gun
And Im going to continue to push for a nofly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track
Well you know once again Donald is implying that he didnt support the invasion of Iraq I said it was a mistake Ive said that years ago He has consistently denied what is
 a very clear fact that
 before the invasion he supported it And you know I just want everybody to go Google it Google Donald Trump Iraq And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq
And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that Now why does that matter Well it matters because he has not told the truth about that position I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it
But whats really important here is to understand all the interplay Mosul is a Sunni city Mosul is on the border of Syria And yes we do need to go after Baghdadi andjust like we went after bin Laden while you were doing Celebrity Apprentice and we brought him to justice We need to go after the leadership
But we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighters There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul Theyve been digging underground Theyve been prepared to defend Its going to be tough fighting But I think we can take back Mosul and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa
This is what we have to do Im just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election but thats how Donald thinks You know he always is looking for some conspiracy
He has all the conspiracy theories
This conspiracy theory which hes been spewing out for quite some time
He says
 unfit and he proves it every time he talks
Well you should ask Bernie Sanders who hes supporting for president And he has said
 as he has campaigned for me around the country you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America I think hes right
Well Chris first of all I think a nofly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict Im well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general
This would not be done just on the first day This would take a lot of negotiation And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground
Weve had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria it would help us with our fight against ISIS
But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees Hes made these claims repeatedly I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in But I am not going to slam the door on women and children That picture of that little 4yearold boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting And so we are going to do very careful thorough vetting That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks In fact the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando the Pulse nightclub was born in Queens the same place Donald was born So lets be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it
And yes some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq and weve got to keep fighting and I will defeat ISIS and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home
Well first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is Make America Great Again I wonder when he thought America was great And before he rushes and says You know before you and President Obama were there I think its important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades
You know back in 1987 he took out a 100000 ad in the New York Times during the time when President Reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said now that we were the laughingstock of the world He was criticizing President Reagan This is the way Donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says You know I alone can fix it as he said on the convention stage
But if you look at the debt which is the issue you asked about Chris I pay for everything Im proposing I do not add a penny to the national debt I take that very seriously because I do think its one of the issues weve got to come to grips with
So when I talk about how were going to pay for education how were going to invest in infrastructure how were going to get the cost of prescription drugs down and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time Ive made it very clear we are going where the money is We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share
And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth In fact I think just the opposite Well have what economists call middleout growth Weve got to get back to rebuilding the middle class the families of America Thats where growth will come from Thats why I want to invest in you I want to invest in your family
And I think thats the smartest way to grow the economy to make the economy fairer And we just have a big disagreement about this It may be because of our experiences You know he started off with his dad as a millionaire
I started off withmy dad was a smallbusiness man
And I think ityou know its a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy
Well Chris I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund Thats part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy My Social Security payroll contribution will go up as will Donalds assuming he cant figure out how to get out of it But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund
 by making sure that we have sufficient resources and that will come from either raising the cap andor finding other ways to get more money into it I will not cut benefits I want to enhance benefits for lowincome workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system
But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a 20 trillion additional national debt That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare
And Ill say something about the Affordable Care Act which he wants to repeal The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund So if he repeals it our Medicare problem gets worse What we need to do is go after
 the longterm health care drivers Weve got to get costs down increase value emphasize wellness I have a plan for doing that And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and smarter decisions
Well I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that Im reaching out to all AmericansDemocrats Republicans and independentsbecause we need everybody to help make our country what it should be to grow the economy to make it fairer to make it work for everyone We need your talents your skills your commitments your energy your ambition
You know Ive been privileged to see the presidency up close And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you I have made the cause of children and families really my lifes work
Thats what my mission will be in the presidency I will stand up for families against powerful interests against corporations I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs with rising incomes that your kids have good educations from preschool through college I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president
